            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Eſau's</hi> Bleſsing, and to content my ſelf with <hi>Alexanders</hi> Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but being of late retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned again to this the place of my Natievity, and permitted to endeavour an honourable and honest ſubſiſtence, I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, my ſelf to <hi>Minerva's</hi> milder tuition and protection.</p>
            <p>In proſecution whereof, meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the enſuing Treatiſe, originally written in my Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors Language, I have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured to make it ſpeak Engliſh, and preſumed to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh it under your Ladiſhips Patronage, the better to ſhelter it from ſuch Criticks of the Times, who ſavour no Viands
<pb facs="tcp:170273:5"/>but of their own fancying and Cookery.</p>
            <p>And although this work in it ſelf may ſeem very improper to be communicated to this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, where every <hi>Matron,</hi> and young <hi>Damſel</hi> are ſo well vers'd in the Pastry Art, as that they may out-vie the beſt Forreign Paſtry Cooks in all the World beſides, yet this ſaid Treatiſe containing nothing ſave <hi>Out-landiſh</hi> Cates and Junkets (farre in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour I must confeſs to ours) I doubt not but will give that ſatisfaction unto your Ladiſhips, and unto all other worthy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons, and ingenuous Damſels,
<pb facs="tcp:170273:6"/>as may encourage my ſelf, the Tranſlator, to proceed to the Engliſhing of other Treatiſes of the like nature, proper for the knowledge, and uſe of ſo judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſonages as your ſelves.</p>
            <p>A Second Motive which made me to adventure upon this peece of Pastry, was, to teſtifie my gratitude to this my Mother City, by preparing (for her Sons and Daughters pleaſures and divertiſements at their ſpare hours) ſome Forreign Cates and Delicacies, happily never as yet taſted within her walls.</p>
            <p>Nor could I omit to dedicate them unto your ſelves (moſt
<pb facs="tcp:170273:6"/>Honoured Ladies (who all three of you, may be juſtly ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to bee the Mirrours of Knowledge and Excellency in theſe laudable Profeſsions, that thereby I might give a teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to the whole World of my ſubmiſsion and obedience unto my Political Parents, your ſelves being ſuch, in reference to thoſe Honourable places of truſt ſo deſervingly conferred, and ſo worthily ſupplied by your Honoured ſecond Selves, who as they are the Supporters of this flouriſhing Cities admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Government, ſo will their renowns, and yours (honoured Ladies) live to all eternity by

                     <hi>To make white Paſte, or Dough, for great Pyes.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>FOr Example, place on your paſtry Table, well cleanſed three quarters of a peck of fine flower, make a hole or hollowneſſe in the middle of it, which concavity the French Paſtry Cooks call a fountain, add unto it two pound of ſweet But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, &amp; in caſe the Butter be hard you muſtwork it with your hands, before you put it upon the paſtry Table, to the end that it may become ſoft;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:170273:14"/>when you have mingled the Butter with the flower, you may adde thereunto about the quantity of three ounces of ſalt reduced to pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and immediately alſo adde thereunto half a pint of fair water, after which you may beginne to make your paſte or dough, which muſt bee very well kneaded; and whilſt you are making of your paſte as aforeſaid, you may by whiles ſprinkle it with water.</p>
               <p>Now when your Paſte is very wel kneaded, you muſt extend it and ſtretch it forth with a woodden rowling Pin, ſtrew ſome flower both upon and under the dough, that ſo it may not ſtick to your paſtry Table, nor rowling Pin.</p>
               <p>You may obſerve once for all, that it is requiſite in Winter, to make the paſte fatter than in ſummer, to render it the more ſupple and tractable, and on the contrary, in Summer or in hot weather, you muſt make the paſte leſſe fat by a little, and conſequently put
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:170273:15"/>leſſe butter therein, for to make it firmer, for the heat doth over ſof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the Dough, and cauſeth it to fall, which is occaſioned by its being made over fat; However you muſt obſerve thus much, alwaies to qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify your paſte proportionably unto the fineneſſe you will have it of.</p>
               <p>You muſt alſo obſerve, that in caſe the weather be cold when you make your paſte, you ſhal do well to cover it with a warm cloath when it is half kneaded, to the end that it may bee the better mollified; after which you may compleat the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and kneading of it, untill your dough be throughly ſtifned, and that you do not feel any clots, or clutters in the kneading of it.</p>

               <p>And when you have a mind to prepare a Paſte to make ſuch a like Pye of, you muſt give it a thickneſs of about three or four half Crowns, but you muſt have a care to make the bottome of the pye ſomewhat thicker, that ſo the Pye it ſelf may be the better ſupported.</p>
               <p>And when as you intend to make uſe of ſuch like paſte for Tarts, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtards, Cheeſe-Cakes, white-pots, Lambs-ſtones and ſweet-breads, and

               <p>AS for Example, lay upon your kneading board or Table, half a peck of wheaten Meal flower, make a hollow in it, and pour a glaſſe of water into it, adde thereunto about half an ounce of beaten Salt, min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle all theſe very well together, to make your paſte or dough, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and anon ſprinkle it with ſome water proportionably as you ſhall finde it to be requiſite.</p>
               <p>When this your Paſte ſhall be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well knitted together, although ſomewhat limber, you may put it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Maſs or round lump, and ſo let it
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:170273:16"/>remain for the ſpace of one half hour or thereabouts, to the end that it may become drye and firm, after which you may extend it with a row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-pin, untill it bee an inch thick, caſting good ſtore of flower upon it now and then.</p>
               <p>After which you may take a pound of good freſh Butter, which is very ſtiff and hard, and ſpread the ſaid Butter over your Paſte, and flatten it upon the Dough with your hands; after which you muſt fold in the four corners of the Dough, or elſe you may only double your Paſte, in ſuch, a manner, as that the Butter may be incloſed in it, which being thus done, you muſt again extend your Paſte, and rowle it very thinne with your Rowling-pin, then double in again the four corners of your Paſte to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the middle, &amp; ſpread it abroad again with your Rowling-pin, and thus you muſt fold it and unfold it five or ſix ſeveral times, that ſo you may finally render your Paſte as thinne as it ſhall be requiſite; Nor
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:170273:17"/>muſt you forget to ſtrow it with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle flower, that it may not ſtick upon your Kneading-board or Table, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon your Rowling-pin nor Fingers.</p>
               <p>Whenſoever you will make uſe of this thin Paſte or Dough towards the making of a Pigeon Pie, or any other Paſtrie work, you may take as great or leſſe a quantity of it, as you may judge convenient, according to the proportion of the Pie you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to make; and having put it up in a maſſe or lump, you may after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards extend it with your Rowling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pin, ſtrowing it with ſome flower, ſo that you may reduce it to the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of about a ſhilling peece in ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
               <p>And when you have thus rowled out your Paſte for the laſt time, you ſhall again ſtrow it with a ſmall quantity of flower, and then double it again, and put it upon one half of the Pie-plate, after which you may abate upon the other half of the Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, the other half of the Dough or
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:170273:17"/>thin Paſte; And finally in this manner you may faſhion and ſhape your Paſtie in ſuch a manner as ſhall bee hereafter deſcribed.</p>
               <p>Note, that in caſe you put leſſe Butter than is preſcribed in your Paſte, it will bee then but a half lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Paſte or Dough.</p>

               <p>CAuſe your Gammon of Bacon to bee ſteeped in water, more or leſſe, according unto its bigneſs, thickneſſe, and dryneſſe.</p>
               <p>In caſe a Gammon of Beacon bee very bigge, well ſmoaked and dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as your <hi>Mayence</hi> Gammonds
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:170273:25"/>and <hi>Bayonne</hi> Gamons uſually are, you muſt let them ſteep in the water, for at leaſt the ſpace of twenty and four hours, or more; and then you may give a gueſſe, whether or no your Gammon bee well ſteep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>Which that you may the better be able to judge of, you ſhall take it out of the ſaid water, and make an opening or hole in the midſt of the fleſh, drawing forth a little peece of it, and by taſting it, you may bee able to judge whether the ſalt and brine be ſufficiently extracted; which having done, and finding it accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to your expectation, you ſhall thus prepare it for to bee put in paſte.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place therefore you muſt pare the top of your Gamon untill you come to the quick fleſh, that ſo you may take off the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies or upper part of the fleſh; &amp; all that you judge to be too dry &amp; ſalt, after which you muſt alſo take away the skin or upper part and you muſt
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:170273:26"/>alſo cut off the knuckle.</p>
               <p>Now having prepared your Gammon in this manner, you muſt knead as much dough as you ſhall judge requiſite for your paſty; and you muſt make your cruſt at leaſt two inches thick or thereabouts, and upon the middle of the bottome of your Paſty, you muſt make a bed or foundation of ſlices of fat Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con.</p>
               <p>This bed or foundation of fat ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con muſt bee as broad as the whole Gammon of Bacon, and upon the ſaid Bed of fat Bacon you muſt place a good round handfull of parſly groſly ſhredded; after that you ſhall ſtrew your Gammon with your ſweet ſpices, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you ſhall place it upon the bed of fat Bacon and parſly, which having done, you ſhall ſtick ſome cloves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your Gammon, and a few ſmall peeces of Mace, after which upon the top of your Gammon, you ſhall lay another Bed of parſly, and a bed of fat Bacon ſliced, and five
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:170273:26"/>or ſix Laurel leaves upon the fat ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, and after that a good half pound of ſweet Butter, which you muſt ſo ſpread as that it may quite cover all the ſlices of fat bacon which lie upon your Gammon.</p>
               <p>Moreover, you ſhall knead as much paſte or dough upon your kneading board as will bee requiſite to make the Cover or Lid of your Paſtle, which dough you muſt mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten with your little bruſh, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly cover your paſty therwith; &amp; having thus quite completed your ſaid Paſty, you muſt ſtraightwayes put it into the Oven, which muſt bee heated in the ſame manner as if you were to bake houſhold bread.</p>
               <p>If your Gammon be a great one, as aforeſaid, it will require 3 houres boyling, but if it bee an indifferent one, two hours &amp; a half wil ſerve, or two houres, according to its bigneſſe.</p>
               <p>When your Paſty hath been in the Oven about half an houre, you muſt make three or four holes in the Lidde, for to give your paſty vent,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:170273:27"/>for otherwiſe it would burſt; And this you muſt obſerve in all great Paſties. Moreover, in caſe the Paſty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruſt doth ſuddenly get a too high colour, and grows black, that's a ſign that your Oven is over heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that it burns your Paſty; wherefore you muſt take away the Embers.</p>
               <p>And on the contrary, if your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty attaines no colour, that's a ſign the Oven is not hot enough, and which will force you to increaſe the Embers, that ſo your Paſty may be throughly baked.</p>

               <p>CAuſe a Gammon of Bacon of <hi>Bayonne,</hi> or of <hi>Mayence,</hi> to bee ſteeped in water, (an ordinary Gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon will ſerve turn) and when your ſaid Gammon is throughly ſteeped, you may take it out of the water, and cleanſe it well on the top of it, and cut off all the yellow rindes, untill you come to the quick fleſh, cut off alſo the knuckle, and take off the skin, and in caſe the fat of the Bacon bee above an Inch thick, you muſt cut off the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus, which will ſerve to be cut in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſlices, and to ſtuff your paſty.</p>
               <p>When as your Bacon is thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, you may cauſe it to be half per
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:170273:28"/>boyled in water, with ſome few Bay leaves, and other ſweet herbs; And when it is half boyled or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, you may take it out of the liquor, and may place it upon a dreſſer-board that it may dry, you may alſo take out the bones of the ſaid Gammon when it is half boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, eſpecially if you intend to have your Paſty to be eaten hot.</p>
               <p>After your Gammon ſhall bee well dryed, you may prepare a Rye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſte, or dough, or a paſte of white meal, without any butter at all; you may alſo make this paſty like unto a venſon-paſty if you pleaſe, but you had better make a pie of it to bee preſently ſerved up, by reaſon of the thickneſſe of your Gammon; Wherefore to make the better hot paſty of this your Gammon, you muſt make up your cruſt in a round form, of a ſufficient bigneſſe, and give it at leaſt half a foot in height, and make it above an inch thick, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which you ſhall line the inſide of your paſtie with a lay of great

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:170273:29"/>beaten Cinamon, upon all which you muſt again lay ſome ſlices of fat bacon, and two or three Bay-leaves.</p>
               <p>When your Paſtie is thus ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and prepared, you muſt cover it with a lid of Dough, which cover muſt bee at leaſt an inch thick, after which you muſt varniſh or burniſh your ſaid lid, and you muſt peirce it in the middle &amp; place upon it a little Cap or Crown of Dough made like unto a Socket, in caſe the Paſtie bee to be eaten hot; after which you may place your Paſtie upon a ſheet or two of Paper to put it into the Oven.</p>
               <p>This Paſtie muſt bee at the leaſt four and twenty or thirty hours a baking; and your Oven muſt bee a little leſs heated than if it were to bake brown bread or Rye bread.</p>
               <p>After your Paſtie ſhall have been five or ſix hours in the Oven, you muſt take it out of the Oven, and place it upon your dreſſer board, and you muſt gueſſe by the lid which you may take off, to ſee whether or no your Paſtie bee full of liquor or of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:170273:29"/>ſauce; for in caſe you find that the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor is diminiſhed, you muſt fill up your Paſtie again with good fleſh broath, which hath been made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Herbs or ſalt; and in caſe you have any Mutton gravy, you may mingle it with your ſaid broath, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which you may cover your Paſty again, and put it into the Oven im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, and every five hours or thereabouts, you muſt take your Paſtie out of the Oven again to ſee whether it bee not grown dry, to the end to fill it up with broath as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid; and in this manner you muſt continue to ſupply your Paſty with broath, untill the meat which is in your ſaid Paſtie ſhall be rotten baked.</p>
               <p>Three or four hours before your ſaid Paſtie ſhall be baked, you may fill it up with Lamb-ſtones, ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breads, <hi>Muſcherons,</hi> and ſuch other like Imbelliſhments which will ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it the more ſavoury and peaſing.</p>

               <p>Having made your paſte, you muſt line it, or fill it within with ſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of fat Bacon, a little Parſly and Time, after which put in your Gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, upon which ſtick a few cloves, and a dozen ſlices of Cinamon, and

               <p>YOu muſt generally obſerve, that no kinde of fleſh whatſoever may be put in paſte before it be mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified; Therefore you muſt let that fleſh which yee do intend to put in paſte bee ſufficiently mortified, which may bee done, by hanging it in the Air, or by burying of it under ground for the ſpace of twenty and four houres; after which you muſt beat the ſaid fleſh-meat more or leſs with a wooden rowler or peſtel, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſaid fleſhes thickneſs and hardneſs, which is a third way to mortifie it; ſo likewiſe muſt you obſerve, that Beef and Mutton muſt bee more beaten and mortified than any other fleſh whatſoever.</p>
               <p>Obſerve likewiſe, that it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to take out the ſuperfluous and

               <p>Obſerve alſo, that in caſe your fleſh which you intend to paſtrie up, hath great nerves &amp; hard ſinnews, or tough skins, you muſt take all that away; as for example, from a ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or leg of Mutton you muſt take off the skin; in the like manner, if you intend to make a Hare-pie, and that you apprehend it may be an old and hard one, you muſt ſtrip off its uppermoſt skin before you lard it.</p>
               <p>Moreover, you muſt obſerve, that in caſe there be hollow places in ſuch fleſh as you intend to paſtrie up, as there is in a Hare, and in ſeveral foul,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:170273:33"/>you muſt bruiſe and break thoſe bones which cauſe that ſame hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowneſs, and ſo make your fleſh e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and ſmooth; As for example, the Maw of a Turki-Cock, which you muſt cut and flaſh at every four fingers diſtance, that ſo you may the better bee able to lard it.</p>
               <p>Now in caſe your Venſon, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther groſs Viands, which you do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to put in paſte, ſhould be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what tainted, or in caſe they ſhould be warm eaten, cauſe water and ſalt to bee boyled together, and let your ſaid Venſon, or other groſs meats ſteep therein, as in a broath, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſo ſteeped for a while, draw it forth again, and hang it up to drye, that ſo the ſaid liquor may run out.</p>
               <p>Now your Viands having been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared according to the ſeveral fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going preſcriptions, you may lard them very cloſe with great peeces of fat Bacon, bigger or leſſer, according to the proportion and quality of your ſeveral ſorts of Viands; ſome
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:170273:33"/>ſlices of Bacon as thick and as long as your little finger, for Venſon, Beef, and Mutton, others leſs, according to your own diſcretion; and it will bee requiſite that you ſteep your lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Bacon ſome pretty while be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you uſe it, in a little Vineger ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned with ſalt; and before you lard your Viands with them, powder them with beaten white Pepper, or with your ſweet ſpices, which you pleaſe.</p>
               <p>And in caſe your Viands be thick, and of the length of half a foot, or thereabouts, as for example, a Briſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket of Veal, or a Turky-Cock, and the like, either lance them, or cut them with Trenches at every four inches diſtance or thereabouts, in ſuch a wiſe however that all the skin, or upper part of the fleſh may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main whole, and by the means of theſe deep Trenches you may eaſily come to lard all the parts of your ſaid Viands, which cannot bee other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe done; Beſides that, your Viands remaining entire and whole, would
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:170273:34"/>bee the more difficult to bee baked, and the ſauce or liquor of your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie would not bee able to penetrate or paſſe through your fleſh, but with a great deal of difficulty, in caſe it were not lanced in the ſame manner as it hath been propoſed.</p>
               <p>Some there be that do ſteep their Beef, Mutton, Veal, and other Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ands which they do intend to put in paſte two or three hours in Verjuice or Vineger ſeaſoned with ſalt and Pepper, or with ſweet ſpices, and with ſome ſweet herbs, and the which muſt bee done, as ſoon as the ſaid Viands ſhall have been beaten with the Peſtel or Rowling-pin, and after the ſaid Viands ſhall have been larded, and when you ſhall have drawn it forth of the ſaid liquor, you muſt perfect the putting of it into paſte in the following manner.</p>
               <p>Your fleſh being ready to be put into paſte, you muſt ſeaſon it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your own diſcretion with your ſalt ſpices, in ſuch a manner as that your ſaid Viands do well retain

               <p>Your Viands being thus ſeaſoned, you muſt place them upon the one end of your Dough or paſte, either framed of Rye cruſt, or of wheaten or white, which you pleaſe, at diſcretion as aforeſaid, which ſaid paſte muſt bee at leaſt an inch in thickneſſe, and long enough to make up the whole Paſtie.</p>
               <p>Your Viand or Venſon, or the like, being placed upon one of the ends of your Paſte, you may ſtick therein ſome few Cloves, and after that you may fill it up with ſome ſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of fat Bacon, unto which you may alſo adde ſome Bay-leaves, and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:170273:35"/>over and above all theſe things you may alſo apply ſome freſh butter ſpread over the whole paſty, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid in the foregoing Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>Obſerve or note, that to make a good Hare, or Turky-pye, or a pye with four Ducks, you muſt have at leaſt a quarter and a half, or much about half a peck and a quarter, or three quarters of a Buſhel of meal; moreover two pounds of butter, and if ſo bee you will have the cruſt to bee very fine, you may put therein two pounds and a half, or three pounds of butter, yet however note this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that the cruſt being ſo fat may bee ſubject to burſt in the Oven.</p>
               <p>Now in caſe your paſty bee of Venſon, or of any other viand that's not fat, as for example, in caſe you have a mind to accomodate a Hare excellently wel, you muſt needs have one half pound, or three quarters of a pound of freſh butter to wrap the Hare in, and at leaſt one pound
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:170273:35"/>and a half, or two pounds of fat ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, as well to lard your viand; as to cover it after it is Empaſted.</p>
               <p>But and if the Meat you intend to put in paſte, bee not over dry nor lean; As for example, ſuppoſe it bee a Turky-cock, well fatned, or a good fat joynt of mutton, you ſhall only ſtand in need of a good quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a pound of freſh butter, to incloſe the ſaid viand withall, and good ſtore of fat Bacon, to lard it to boot, wherein you muſt not fail.</p>
               <p>Another obſervation you may take along with you, that ſome paſtry-men do make uſe of ſweet ſuet, inſtead of freſh butter, to raiſe their paſte withall.</p>
               <p>Finally, So ſoon as your fleſh ſhall bee well and throughly ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with all the requiſite ſpices, and ingredients aforenamed, and that it ſhall bee well lined with butter below and above, you may as then turn up the end of the paſte which is left, over the whole, only
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:170273:36"/>moiſtening the end of the paſte which remains, to refreſh it, and joyn well the ſides, and when you have thus well joyned or added the ſides, you may give it what ſhape you will, after which you may burniſh your Pye or Paſty, and immediately after you may put it to the Oven.</p>
               <p>Obſerve, that your Oven muſt bee almoſt as hot, as is preſcribed in the precedent Chapter, and thus theſe foregoing Paſties, will be ſufficiently baked in two hours ſpace provided they bee not extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great and thick ones. And when your ſaid Paſties ſhall bee thus well and throughly baked, and cooled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, you muſt not forget to ſtop the holes which you made in their liddes. For the reaſons before al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged.</p>
               <p>By reaſon that in caſe you do not make the ſaid holes in the Lidde of your ſaid Paſtie, within a little while after it hath been in the Oven, it will ſplit or burn by reaſon of the heat.</p>

               <p>Now your Meat being thus well chopped, you muſt make up your Paſty of Rie-cruſt, and give it at leaſt two inches in thickneſs, proportionably according unto the bigheſſe of your Paſty, and raiſe the paſte thereof high enough.</p>

               <p>After which you may prepare a paſte of fine dough, of a round form, and you may fill it up half full with your minced meat, which having well plained, and preſſed cloſe to your Cruſt, you may lay thereon a few ſparagus, or ſome peeces of Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichoak bottoms, or <hi>Muſcherons,</hi> yolks of Eggs boiled hard, and cut in quarters, ſome ſlices of Ox tongues, in caſe you have them at hand, ſome ſheeps Plucks, ſome <hi>Piſtaches,</hi>

               <p>TAke a fair large Carp, or any other fiſh that is large and big; and if it bee a ſcale fiſh, you muſt ſcrape off the ſcales; and afterwards gut it; ſome kind of fiſhes there are which you muſt flea like as you do Eeles,</p>
               <p>After you have thus gutted the fiſh, you may alſo take out its lungs which is nought to bee eaten either boyled, baked or ſtewed.</p>

               <p>TAke what kind of Fiſh ſoever you pleaſe, as for example, a Carp, or an Eele, or a Tench, or a Roche, fit and prepare them in the ſame manner as we have preſcribed you in the foregoing Chapter, ſave an Eele, that you muſt not lard them.</p>
               <p>Some are of Opinion, that it is beſt to perboyle the Fiſh in hot water, after it ſhall have been prepared and accommodated, eſpecially if the ſaid Fiſh bee ſlimy or gravelly, as your Tenches or Eeles are; which muſt bee done before you put them into the Paſte; which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo practiſed by the Paſtry Men; for you muſt note that in caſe you put Raw Fiſh into Paſte it will make your Pye burſt.</p>

               <p>When as your fiſh ſhall bee thus prepared, you muſt alſo make rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy your Paſte of fine or leaved dough, and you muſt proportion it to the length and height of your Fiſh; And you muſt alſo obſerve, that all Fiſh Pyes are commonly made Oval-wiſe; However you muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo obſerve, that the cruſt of ſuch like Pyes is not uſually made ſo very fine as the others, that is to ſay, you muſt not put ſo much butter in the Dough, eſpecially when you intend to make the ſaid Pyes open becauſe that otherwiſe the cruſt would eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fall down, and your ſauce would bee ſpilt, the cruſt muſt bee about the thickneſs of two or three half crowns at leaſt.</p>
               <p>You muſt therefore obſerve not to make the paſte of your ſaid fiſh Pyes ſo very thinne, and that your good Paſtry men do knead it with hot water, to make it the firmer; and when you ſhall have made up your cruſt for a fiſh Pye, which is to bee open or uncovered, you muſt leave
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:170273:57"/>it in the ayre for the ſpace of an hour or two, that ſo it may become firm before you put your fiſh into it.</p>
               <p>And you muſt proportion the greatneſſe of your Cruſt unto the bigneſſe of the fiſh which you do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to put into it; And after your ſaid Paſty cruſt ſhall bee well thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and firmed, you ſhall place in the bottome of it, a lay of freſh but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and you muſt powder it with your ſalt ſpices, and ſo lay your fiſh upon it; which you muſt have lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the fleſhieſt parts before you put it into the ſaid Paſte, And in caſe you have cut your fiſh in Morcels, you muſt have a care to place the ſaid peeces in their proper places, and if your Pye bee made Ovall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, as then put a lay of butter in the fiſhes belly, and another lay on the top of your ſaid fiſh, after which ſeaſon it with your ſaid ſalt ſpices, you may alſo lay at your fiſhes ſides the Rowes and Milters, and you muſt alſo powder them with your

               <p>Moreover in caſe your cruſt bee very fine, or that you apprehend that it may chance to fall when it is in the Oven, when your ſaid pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty ſhall be well moiſtned with your melted butter, you muſt as then ſwathe it without, and you may alſo put a double ſwathe of paper in the inſide of your Paſty before you fill it up.

               <p>Moreover, theſe Fiſh-pyes which are uncovered, may bee very well baked in an houre, or an hour and a halfs time, provided that they bee of a middle ſize.</p>
               <p>Obſerve that in caſe you bee minded to put a whole Eele in paſte, and to make an open paſty of it, you muſt open it, and cut it at every four inches length or thereabouts,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:170273:58"/>for if ſo bee you do not break it, it wil prick it ſelf up in the baking, and in its ſtretching it ſelf forth, it may chance to break your Paſty and ſo ſpoil it, wherefore its better to cut it into morcels, as long as you pleaſe your ſelf.</p>
               <p>You may alſo make theſe fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyes covered, and to this purpoſe you muſt make your Paſty large and long enough, to make your Paſty all of a peece, in the ſame manner as you do make a Venſon-paſty.</p>

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:170273:61"/>As for example in a Carp, But by reaſon that this way or manner of unboneing a fiſh is hard and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what difficult, and that alſo the fleſh of your fiſh being put into your Pies raw, will make them burſt; it is therefore neceſſary that you cauſe your fiſh thus to be unboned.</p>
               <p>When your fiſh is ſcaled and ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, you muſt plunge it into water, which is almoſt boyling hot, and let it ſteep therein more or leſſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto the thickneſſe of your ſaid fiſh; and you may know when it is time to draw it forth of the ſaid water, which you may do, when you may eaſily ſeparate the fiſh from the bones, and in this manner you will eaſily unbone your fiſh; But whereas the hot water doth take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way part of the fiſhes taſte, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, you muſt therefore cauſe it to bee boyled in a thin broath, and after you ſhall have ſuffered your ſaid fiſh to have become cold in the ſaid thin broath, that ſo it may partake of the taſte of it, you may
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:170273:62"/>eaſily ſeparate the fleſh from the bones of the fiſh.</p>
               <p>Having thus ſeparated the bones from the fiſh, you muſt place it upon a table, adding thereunto a little Parſly, ſome Salt, and a few Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherons cut in ſlices, and a few ſpices, and if you have a mind to have your ſaid Pies be ſweet, you may adde unto them a few Currans, and ſome Pine-apple kernels, well waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; All which ingredients you muſt mince together, and when your minced fiſh is thus prepared, you may fill up your Pies therewith, as it hath been already deſcribed.</p>
               <p>Now if you have any minced fiſh remaining over and above, you may put it into a Porrenger with ſome Butter and an Onion, or with a Leek, and cauſe them to bee all boyled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and whileſt they are a boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, you muſt now and then ſtir them, and adde unto them a few Capers, and a little thin broath if you have any, and at the latter end a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Verjuice.</p>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:170273:62"/>
               <p>When your ſaid minced fiſh is thus boyled, and that your ſauce is become ſavoury, you muſt take out your Onion or Leek, and you muſt grate a ſmall quantity of Nutmeg upon your ſaid minced meat, in caſe you have put no ſpices into it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>You may alſo adde unto your ſaid minced fiſh ſome ſlices of fryed bread, as alſo a quantity. of <hi>Almane,</hi> or Dutch ſauce, in caſe you have not any thing broath to put into it.</p>
               <p>And the better to diſguiſe your minced fiſh, you may mince amongſt it ſome yolks and whites of Eggs hard boyled, or elſe you may adde thereunto ſome gravy of a joynt of Mutton, or of any other good meat.</p>
               <p>Moreover, in caſe you deſire to make any Chitterlings or Links of your ſaid minced fiſh; take your ſaid minced fiſh before it bee per boyled in Butter, and ſprinkle it with the white of an Egge, or with a little Verjuice, or a little white Wine, after which
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:170273:63"/>you muſt preſs or ſqueeze your min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced fiſh in your hands, to incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate it in the manner of Chitterlings, after which you may cauſe them to be baked in the ſame manner as your minced Pies.</p>
               <p>Some do cauſe their minced fiſh to bee perboyled before they do maketheir Pies of them, but when once the minced fiſh happens to bee perboyled, it becomes too too flaſhy, or waſhy by reaſon of the ſauce which is added thereunto.</p>

                  <p>When your Omelet is thus half baked, turn it with a Trencher or Skimmer, to cauſe it to bee baked on both ſides, and to hinder it from ſticking or cleaving to the pan, and that it may not burn, ſtir your pan very often.</p>
                  <p>When your ſaid Omelet is ſerved up, you muſt powder it with ſome Sugar, and ſprinkle it with ſome Roſe-water or Cinamon water.</p>
